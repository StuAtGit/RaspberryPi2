== GPIO Daemon for the Raspberry PI 2

Currently, all this really does is demonstrate the use of the pi4j library to turn a
GPIO pin on the Raspberry PI 2 on and off.
(The python library I tried only worked with the PI 1)

Eventually, I would like to this to subscribe to an MQTT server I have in the cloud,
and turn pins on and off via commands sent over the appropriate topic.
